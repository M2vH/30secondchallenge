Based on the game created by https://github.com/christianp/30secondchallenge.

Added some features and translated into german.

You can turn off the timer, and the infinity time limit will not start a timer.

Added some CSS for printing, now 3 challenges will fit on an A4 sheet, the answers will be empty, all unneccessary stuff will be hidden. Now you can printout some hardcopy challenges.
